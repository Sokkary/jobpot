Stretching Goals
----------------

IPFS:
dApp is relying on the IPFS storage for all job details as (JSON Document) and (Attachments/files) where we store only the ipfs hash in the contract.

Testnet:
The contracts have been deployed to `rinkeby` and the addresses are:
  - Rinkeby Contract Address: 0xe30a73f32e11cd554b013b24f98fa97c523a6b3e
