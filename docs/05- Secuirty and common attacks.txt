Security and Common Attacks Used in The Jobpot
-----------------------------------------------

-----------------------
Attacks
-----------------------
 - TX.Origin
 Tx origin can be manipulated, thus we avoided using it in our contracts and instead relied on proper use of msg.sender instead.

 - Gas limit 
 Gas limit attach has been avoided by:
  - Eliminating the array loops, 
  - Eliminating recursions ,
  - Eliminating external function calls, 
  - Limiting user input data length.

-----------------------
 Tools & Best practices
 -----------------------
 We've used some suitable practices for our case such as:
	- Circuit breaker design pattern
	- Catch bugs before release by running:
		- Automated testing
	- Keep contract code simple; complexity == more bugs
	- Only use blockchain when necessary
    - Blockchain used to manage payments while majority of data storage and retrieval off-loaded to the dApp and IPFS storage.
	- Avoiding calling external contracts
	- Sanitize user inputs
